# Layouts Directory

This directory contains layout files for your application.

## Files

- `application.dart` - Main application layout (Rails-like wrapper)

## Usage

The layout is automatically generated when you run:
```bash
nevaeh dev
```

Or when you generate your first view:
```bash
nevaeh generate view home
```

## File Location

If you can't see the file in your IDE:
1. Refresh your file explorer
2. Navigate to: `web/layouts/application.dart`
3. Or open it directly: `cursor web/layouts/application.dart`

The file definitely exists at: `/var/dart_ui/kothari_css_test/web/layouts/application.dart`
